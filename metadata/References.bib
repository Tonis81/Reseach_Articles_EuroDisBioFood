	abstract = {Disaster and space environments are similar in that they are closed environment, with limited lifelines. Here, we examined the similarity between disaster food and space food, to explore interactive problem-solving of food support for disaster and space environments. The Japan Disaster Food Certification Standards (Japan Disaster Food Society) and the Japanese Space Food Certification Standards (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) requirements and certified products, which were posted on the websites as of June 16, 2021, were compared. Certified products were classified into "staple foods," "main and/or side dishes," "milk and dairy products," "fruits," "confectionery and favorite beverages," "condiments," "dietary supplements," and "sets." Certification standards involved six items for Japan Disaster Food and eight items for Japanese Space Food. Most standards were similar. Concretely, both standards demanded room temperature storage, tough packaging and hygiene management in facilities. Both emphasized habitual food and easy eating. However, the best-by date was ≥6 mo for Japan Disaster Food, but ≥1.5 y for Japanese Space Food. In addition, Japanese Space Food required noted nutritious, food hygienic, eatable in space, cookable by specific equipment, endurable pressure by launch, and domestically produced food. There were 171 and 47 products of Japan Disaster Food and Japanese Space Food, respectively. Staple foods (pregelatinized rice, etc.) and main and/or side dishes were commonest among Japan Disaster Foods and Japanese Space Foods, respectively. It is possible to utilize of Space Food as Disaster Food, but there are some issues that must be cleared before "utilization of Disaster Food as Space Food."},

	abstract = {Diet plays a pivotal role in the onset and course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients are keen to know what to eat to reduce symptoms and flares, but dietary guidelines are lacking. To advice patients, an overview of the current evidence on food (group) level is needed. This narrative review studies the effects of food (groups) on the onset and course of IBD and if not available the effects in healthy subjects or animal and in vitro IBD models. Based on this evidence the Groningen anti-inflammatory diet (GrAID) was designed and compared on food (group) level to other existing IBD diets. Although on several foods conflicting results were found, this review provides patients a good overview. Based on this evidence, the GrAID consists of lean meat, eggs, fish, plain dairy (such as milk, yoghurt, kefir and hard cheeses), fruit, vegetables, legumes, wheat, coffee, tea and honey. Red meat, other dairy products and sugar should be limited. Canned and processed foods, alcohol and sweetened beverages should be avoided. This comprehensive review focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of foods providing IBD patients with the best evidence on which foods they should eat or avoid to reduce flares. This was used to design the GrAID.},

@article{Menal-Puey:2018aa,
	abstract = {Vegan diets in children need to be adequately planned so they can safely meet children's requirements for growth and development. Adequate and realistic meal planning guidelines should not be difficult to achieve, thanks to the increasing number and availability of natural and fortified vegan foods, which can help children to meet all their nutrients requirements. In order to ensure an adequate supply of key nutrients, families and health professionals need accurate, reliable, and easy-to-use meal planning tools. The aim of this article is to provide a practical approach system to meal planning, based on the same food exchange methodology that has been already published in adults. Daily portions of each food exchange group have been calculated so the resulting menu provides at least 90% of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) of protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and n-3 fatty acids for each age group, sex, and physical activity level. These diets do not provide enough vitamin B-12 and vitamin D. Although fortified plant drinks, breakfast cereals or plant protein-rich products could provide variable amounts of these two vitamins, B12 supplementation is always recommended and vitamin D supplementation should be considered whenever sun exposure is limited. This tool can be used to plan healthful and balanced vegan diets for children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Algae are common all over the Earth. Due to their rich chemical composition and content of bioactive substances they have been used in many fields of industry. Their gelling, thickening and stabilizing properties have led to the development of such products as agar, alginate and carrageenan. Moreover, algae are used in the food industry as food supplements and an addition to functional food. Algae are also added to meat products, such as pasty, steaks, frankfurters and sausages, as well as to fish, fish products, and oils, to improve their quality. Cereal-based products, such as pasta, flour and bread, are another group of products enriched with algae. Due to their properties algae may also be used for construction of fermented functional food. Fermented products containing algae are, most of all, dairy products, such as cheese, cream, milk deserts, yoghurt, cottage cheese, and processed cheese. Combination of fermented products offering a high content of lactic acid bacteria with algae possessing biologically active metabolites of natural origin allows not only to compose products with a high content of nutrients, but also to create a brand new segment of fermented food.},
