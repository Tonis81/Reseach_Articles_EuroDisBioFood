@article{Aylward2014,
	abstract = {Urinary dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) are among the commonly used biomarkers for inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure, but may also arise from seafood consumption and organoarsenical pesticide applications. We examined speciated urinary arsenic data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 cycle to assess potential correlations among urinary DMA, MMA, and the organic arsenic species arsenobetaine. Urinary DMA and MMA were positively associated with urinary arsenobetaine, suggesting direct exposure to these species in seafood or metabolism of organic arsenicals to these species, although the biomonitoring data do not directly identify the sources of exposure. The magnitude of association was much larger for DMA than for MMA. The secondary methylation index (SMI, ratio of urinary DMA to MMA) observed in the NHANES program likewise is much higher in persons with detected arsenobetaine than in those without, again suggesting that direct DMA exposure is co-occurring with exposure to arsenobetaine. Urinary MMA was less correlated with organic arsenic exposures than DMA and, therefore, may be a more reliable biomarker for iAs exposure in the general US population. However, given the associations between both MMA and DMA and organic arsenic species in urine, interpretations of the urinary arsenic concentrations observed in the NHANES in the context of potential arsenic exposure should be made cautiously. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

@article{Kuiper2022,
	abstract = {Background: Guidance is lacking for how to combine urinary biomarker data across studies that use different measures of urinary dilution, i.e., creatinine or specific gravity. Methods: Among 741 pregnant participants from four sites of The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES) cohort, we assessed the relation of maternal urinary di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) concentrations with preterm birth. We compared scenarios in which all sites measured either urinary creatinine or specific gravity, or where measure of dilution differed by site. In addition to a scenario with no dilution adjustment, we applied and compared three dilution-adjustment approaches: a standard regression-based approach for creatinine, a standard approach for specific gravity (Boeniger method), and a more recently developed approach that has been applied to both (covariate-adjusted standardization method). For each scenario and dilution-adjustment method, we estimated the association between a doubling in the molar sum of DEHP (∑DEHP) and odds of preterm birth using logistic regression. Results: All dilution-adjustment approaches yielded comparable associations (odds ratio [OR]) that were larger in magnitude than when we did not perform dilution-adjustment. A doubling of ∑DEHP was associated with 9{\%} greater odds of preterm birth (OR: 1.09, 95{\%} CI: 0.91, 1.30) when applying no dilution adjustment method, whereas dilution-adjusted point estimates were higher, and similar across all scenarios and methods: 1.13--1.20 (regression-based), 1.15--1.18 (Boeniger), and 1.14--1.21 (covariate-adjusted standardization). Conclusions: In our applied example, we demonstrate that it is possible and straightforward to combine urinary biomarker data across studies when measures of dilution differ.

@article{Valera-Gran2017,
	abstract = {Background: The benefits of the use of folic acid supplements (FASs) during the periconception period to prevent neural tube defects and to ensure normal brain development in offspring are well known. There is concern, however, about the long-term effects of the maternal use of high dosages of FASs that exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) (≥1000 $\mu$g/d) on child neurocognitive outcomes.Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between the use of high dosages of FASs during pregnancy and child neuropsychological development at ages 4-5 y.Design: The multicenter prospective mother-child cohort study, the Infancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project, was conducted in 4 regions of Spain: Asturias, Sabadell, Gipuzkoa, and Valencia. Pregnant women were recruited between 2003 and 2008. Data on 1682 mother-child pairs were included in the final analyses. The pregnant women completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire that was validated to estimate typical dietary folate intake and the use of FASs at 10-13 and 28-32 wk of gestation. Neuropsychological development scores at 4-5 y of age were estimated with the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multiple linear regression and meta-analysis were used to obtain combined-effect estimates.Results: During the periconception period, one-third of the women (n = 502) took FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d. The use of FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d in this period was negatively associated with several neuropsychological outcomes scores in children: global verbal ($\beta$ = -2.49; 95{\%} CI: -4.71, -0.27), verbal memory ($\beta$ = -3.59; 95{\%} CI: -6.95, -0.23), cognitive function of posterior cortex ($\beta$ = -2.31; 95{\%} CI: -4.45, -0.18), and cognitive function of left posterior cortex ($\beta$ = -3.26; 95{\%} CI: -5.51, -1.01).Conclusions: The use of FAS dosages exceeding the UL (≥1000 $\mu$g/d) during the periconception period was associated with lower levels of cognitive development in children aged 4-5 y. The use of FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d during pregnancy should be monitored and prevented as much as possible, unless medically prescribed.},

@article{Julvez2011,
	abstract = {Objective: We studied the associations between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and the neurobehavioral status in two population-based birth cohorts. Methods: Children (n=467) were assessed by psychologists and teachers for neuropsychological functioning (McCarthy Scales, MCSA), inattention-hyperactivity symptoms (ADHD-DSM-IV form list) and social behavior (California Preschool Social Competence Scale, CPSCS). Regression models were used with covariate adjustment. Results: Sixteen percent of children had ADHD-DSM-IV symptoms. MCSA scores were linearly associated with ADHD symptom scores (general cognitive Beta. =-0.6 [-1.0; -0.3] per symptom), specifically inattention scores (general cognitive Beta. =-1.8 [-2.3; -1.2]). CPSCS scores were associated with ADHD symptoms (Beta. =-2.19 [-2.5; -1.9]). MCSA scores of executive function, perceptive-performance and quantitative sub-areas had stronger associations with ADHD symptoms. Conclusions: Preschooler ADHD symptoms are associated with concurrent decrements in neurocognitive and social competence functioning. The association patterns are similar to those found in older children with ADHD symptomology (Marks et al., 2005 [36], Seidman, 2006 [46], Sonuga-Barke et al., 2003 [48], Yochman et al., 2006 [53]). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

@article{Forns2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wide range of neuropsychological development outcomes in children are currently measured in a large number of birth cohort and child cohort studies. METHODS: We summarized neuropsychological development assessment protocols from a number of birth cohort studies, reviews and specific books on child neuropsychology into a unifying conceptual framework. RESULTS: We suggest that neuropsychological development can be differentiated into two levels, i.e. functional and clinical. The functional level includes the skills, abilities, capacities and knowledge acquired during maturation of the brain as a result of the development of neural networks. It can be further divided into cognitive, psychomotor and social-emotional development subdomains. The clinical level includes the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders or the presence of symptoms (subclinical symptomatology) of these disorders in populations under investigation in environmental epidemiology studies. CONCLUSIONS: Through explicit recognition of these levels of outcomes, and in using this framework, epidemiologists will be better able to design research through the informed selection of individual levels of outcomes. The framework also serves to standardize disparate terminologies across this field and allows for pooling of epidemiological data on neuropsychological endpoints where essentially similar levels of outcomes have been analyzed using different tests.},

As previously no tool for neuropsychological assessment has been developed in or adapted to Basque, the aim of this study was to adapt and validate the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities for 4 years old children. The adaptation and validation of the original instrument followed the methodological steps established by the International Test Commission. We examined the psychometric properties of the adapted instrument in 273 Basque preschool children (aged between 4 years and 4 months and 4 years and 11 months; 52.2{\%} boys). Confirmatory factor analysis showed satisfactory fit indexes except for the General Cognitive and Memory scales. Most scales presented adequate internal consistency (Reliability coefficients ranged between .55 and .81). The Basque version also showed evidence of validity based on the relationship between neuropsychological development and sex, parental education, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like behaviours and early neurodevelopment (p  {\textless}  .05; effect sizes ranged between Cohen's d = .26 and .52 and r = .15 and 39). The Basque MSCA can be regarded as a useful tool to evaluate cognitive and psychomotor development in preschool children.},

@article{Basu2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Minamata Convention on Mercury provided a mandate for action against global mercury pollution. However, our knowledge of mercury exposures is limited because there are many regions and subpopulations with little or no data. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to increase worldwide understanding of human exposures to mercury by collecting, collating, and analyzing mercury concentrations in biomarker samples reported in the published scientific literature. METHOD: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed scientific literature was performed using three databases. A priori search strategy, eligibility criteria, and data extraction steps were used to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: We collected 424,858 mercury biomarker measurements from 335,991 individuals represented in 312 articles from 75 countries. General background populations with insignificant exposures have blood, hair, and urine mercury levels that generally fall under [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], respectively. We identified four populations of concern: a) Arctic populations who consume fish and marine mammals; b) tropical riverine communities (especially Amazonian) who consume fish and in some cases may be exposed to mining; c) coastal and/or small-island communities who substantially depend on seafood; and d) individuals who either work or reside among artisanal and small-scale gold mining sites. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that all populations worldwide are exposed to some amount of mercury and that there is great variability in exposures within and across countries and regions. There remain many geographic regions and subpopulations with limited data, thus hindering evidence-based decision making. This type of information is critical in helping understand exposures, particularly in light of certain stipulations in the Minamata Convention on Mercury. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3904.},

	abstract = {Cadmium is a naturally-occurring element, and humans are exposed from cigarettes, food, and industrial sources. Following exposure, cadmium accumulates in the kidney and is slowly released into the urine, usually proportionally to the levels found in the kidneys. Cadmium levels in a single spot urine sample have been considered indicative of long-term exposure to cadmium; however, such a potentially exceptional biomarker requires careful scrutiny. In this review, we report good to excellent temporal stability of urinary cadmium (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.66--0.81) regardless of spot urine or first morning void sampling. Factors such as changes in smoking habits and diseases characterized by increased excretion of proteins may produce short-term changes in urinary cadmium levels. We recommend that epidemiologists use this powerful biomarker in prospective studies stratified by smoking status, along with thoughtful consideration of additional factors that can influence renal physiology and cadmium excretion.},

	abstract = {Infants and young children commonly consume apple-based products, which may contain high concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs). As yet, iAs exposure from ingesting apple products has not been well characterized in early childhood. Therefore, we investigated the association between urinary arsenic concentrations and intake of apple products in 1-year-old infants participating in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. A 3-day food diary prior to collection of a spot urine sample was used to determine infant's consumption of apple products. The sum of urinary iAs, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid, referred to as $\Sigma$As, was used to estimate iAs exposure. A total of 242 infants had urinary arsenic speciation analyzed without indication of fish/seafood consumption (urinary arsenobetaine {\textless} 1 µg/L) and with a completed 3-day food diary. Of these, 183 (76{\%}) infants ate apples or products containing apple. The geometric mean urinary $\Sigma$As among the 59 infants who did not consume any type of apple product was 2.78 µg/L as compared to 2.38, 2.46, 2.28, and 2.73 µg/L among infants who exclusively consumed apple juice (n = 30), apple puree (n = 67), apples as whole fruit (n = 20), or products mixed with apples (n = 21), respectively. Differences in urinary $\Sigma$As associated with apple consumption were not statistically significant in generalized linear models adjusted for urine dilution, rice consumption, and household water arsenic. Thus, while infants in our study frequently consumed apples and apple products, we did not find evidence that it increased iAs exposure.},

@article{Lubin2004,
	abstract = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of "fill-in" values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5-10{\%}). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30{\%} or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

	abstract = {Two methods for the fast separation of arsenic species are presented. The general approach is to modify existing methodology utilizing carbonate eluents for a small particle size, short column length Hamilton PRPX100 column which is interfaced with the Agilent 8800 ICP-QQQ using oxygen as reaction gas and detection of AsO at m/z 91. Using H2O2 in the extractant to oxidize As(III) to As(V) it is possible to separate arsenobetaine from DMA, MMA and As(V) in 1.5 minutes. Such a method may be useful where a measure of total inorganic As is sufficient, for example for regulatory compliance in food or beverage testing. It is possible to separate six As species. i.e the four above and arsenocholine and As(III) in 4.5 minutes using a gradient separation. Such a method could be useful analysis of urinary arsenic species. Coupling with high sensitivity of ICP-QQQ yields equivalent or better detection limits than conventional methods with run times up to 5 times faster, which is a significant benefit for sample throughput and method development.},

@article{Carrico2015,
	abstract = {In risk evaluation, the effect of mixtures of environmental chemicals on a common adverse outcome is of interest. However, due to the high dimensionality and inherent cor-relations among chemicals that occur together, the traditional methods (e.g. ordinary or logistic regression) suffer from collinearity and variance inflation, and shrinkage meth-ods have limitations in selecting among correlated components. We propose a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach to estimating a body burden index, which identifies " bad actors " in a set of highly correlated environmental chemicals. We evaluate and charac-terize the accuracy of WQS regression in variable selection through extensive simulation studies through sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ability of the WQS method to select the bad actors correctly and not incorrect ones). We demonstrate the improvement in accu-racy this method provides over traditional ordinary regression and shrinkage methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net). Results from simulations demonstrate that WQS regression is accurate under some environmentally relevant conditions, but its accuracy decreases for a fixed correlation pattern as the association with a response variable dimin-ishes. Nonzero weights (i.e., weights exceeding a selection threshold parameter) may be used to identify bad actors; however, components within a cluster of highly correlated ac-tive components tend to have lower weights, with the sum of their weights representative of the set.

	abstract = {Introduction. Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and are more likely to develop wheezing. Little evidence is available on the effect of in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We used a previously validated non-invasive method to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the infants' respiratory function. Methods. We collected respiratory-function data from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort Study. During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born. We used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory time, tE, and tPTEF. Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers (238). Results. Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently associated with respiratory rate ($\beta$ coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE 0.005], p {\textless} 0.01), age ($\beta$ coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p {\textless} 0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy ({\textgreater} 10 cigarettes daily; $\beta$ coefficient -0.049 [0.022], p {\textless} 0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p {\textless} 0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028 [0.014], p {\textless} 0 05). Conclusions. In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.},

	abstract = {Background: Arsenic exposure through drinking water is an established lung carcinogen. Evidence on non-malignant lung outcomes is less conclusive and suggests arsenic is associated with lower lung function. Studies examining low-moderate arsenic ({\textless} 50 $\mu$g/L), the level relevant for most populations, are limited. We evaluated the association of arsenic exposure with respiratory health in American Indians from the Northern Plains, the Southern Plains and the Southwest United States, communities with environmental exposure to inorganic arsenic through drinking water. Methods: The Strong Heart Study is a prospective study of American Indian adults. This analysis used urinary arsenic measurements at baseline (1989-1991) and spirometry at Visit 2 (1993-1995) from 2132 participants to evaluate associations of arsenic exposure with airflow obstruction, restrictive pattern, self-reported respiratory disease, and symptoms. Results: Airflow obstruction was present in 21.5{\%} and restrictive pattern was present in 14.4{\%}. The odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for obstruction and restrictive patterns, based on the fixed ratio definition, comparing the 75th to 25th percentile of arsenic, was 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and 1.27 (1.01, 1.60), respectively, after adjustments, and 1.28 (1.02, 1.60) and 1.33 (0.90, 1.50), respectively, based on the lower limit of normal definition. Arsenic was associated with lower percent predicted FEV1 and FVC, self-reported emphysema and stopping for breath. Conclusion: Low-moderate arsenic exposure was positively associated with restrictive pattern, airflow obstruction, lower lung function, self-reported emphysema and stopping for breath, independent of smoking and other lung disease risk factors. Findings suggest that low-moderate arsenic exposure may contribute to restrictive lung disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic has been linked to disrupted immune function and greater infection susceptibility in highly exposed populations. Well arsenic levels above the EPA limit occur in our U.S. study area and are of particular concern for pregnant women and infants. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether in utero arsenic exposure affects the risk of infections and respiratory symptoms over the first year of life. METHODS: We prospectively obtained information on infant infections and symptoms, including their duration and treatment (n = 412) at 4, 8 and 12 months using a parental telephone survey. Using generalized estimating equation models adjusted for potential confounders, we evaluated the association between maternal pregnancy urinary arsenic and infant infections and symptoms over the first year. RESULTS: Each doubling of maternal urinary arsenic was related to increases in the total number of infections requiring prescription medication in the first year (RR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.2). Urinary arsenic was related specifically to respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing, wheezing and cough) lasting {\textgreater}/= 2 days or requiring prescription medication (RR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.2; RR = 1.2; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.5, respectively), and wheezing lasting {\textgreater}/=2 days, resulting in a doctor visit or prescription medication treatment (RR = 1.3; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.7; RR = 1.3; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.8, and RR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 2.2). Associations also were observed with diarrhea (RR = 1.4; 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 1.9) and fever resulting in a doctor visit (RR = 1.2; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: In utero arsenic exposure was associated with a higher risk of infection during the first year of life in our study population, particularly infections requiring medical treatment, and with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms.},

@article{Harris2018,
	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the impact of postnatal dexamethasone treatment on the neonatal unit on the school age lung function of very prematurely born children. Children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had been entered into a randomised trial of two methods of neonatal ventilation (United Kingdom Oscillation Study). They had comprehensive lung function measurements at 11 to 14 years of age. One hundred and seventy-nine children born at a mean gestational age of 26.9 (range 23--28) weeks were assessed at 11 to 14 years; 50 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Forced expiratory flow at 75{\%} (FEF75), 50{\%}, 25{\%} and 25--75{\%} of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes including total lung capacity and residual volume were assessed. Lung function outcomes were compared between children who had and had not been exposed to dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors using linear mixed effects regression. After adjustment for confounders all the mean spirometry results were between 0.38 and 0.87 standard deviations lower in those exposed to dexamethasone compared to the unexposed. For example, the mean FEF75 z-score was 0.53 lower (95{\%} CI 0.21 to 0.85). The mean lung function was lower as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. In conclusion, postnatal dexamethasone exposure was associated with lower mean lung function at school age in children born extremely prematurely. Our results suggest the larger the cumulative dose the greater the adverse effect on lung function at follow-up.},

@article{Culver2017,
	abstract = {Background: The American Thoracic Society committee on Proficiency Standards for Pulmonary Function Laboratories has recognized the need for a standardized reporting format for pulmonary function tests. Although prior documents have offered guidance on the reporting of test data, there is considerable variability in how these results are presented to end users, leading to potential confusion and miscommunication. Methods: A project task force, consisting of the committee as a whole, was approved to develop a new Technical Standard on reporting pulmonary function test results. Three working groups addressed the presentation format, the reference data supporting interpretation of results, and a system for grading quality of test efforts. Each group reviewed relevant literature and wrote drafts that were merged into the final document. Results: This document presents a reporting format in test-specific units for spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity that can be assembled into a report appropriate for a laboratory's practice. Recommended reference sources are updated with data for spirometry and diffusing capacity published since prior documents. A grading system is presented to encourage uniformity in the important function of test quality assessment. Conclusions: The committee believes that wide adoption of these formats and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results.},

@article{Bobb2015,
	abstract = {Because humans are invariably exposed to complex chemical mixtures, estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant exposures is of critical concern in environmental epidemiology, and to regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.},

@article{Bobb2018,
	abstract = {Estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures is of increasing interest in environmental epidemiology. Recently, a new approach for estimating the health effects of mixtures, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), has been developed. This method estimates the multivariable exposure-response function in a flexible and parsimonious way, conducts variable selection on the (potentially high-dimensional) vector of exposures, and allows for a grouped variable selection approach that can accommodate highly correlated exposures. However, the application of this novel method has been limited by a lack of available software, the need to derive interpretable output in a computationally efficient manner, and the inability to apply the method to non-continuous outcome variables. This paper addresses these limitations by (i) introducing an open-source software package in the R programming language, the bkmr R package, (ii) demonstrating methods for visualizing high-dimensional exposure-response functions, and for estimating scientifically relevant summaries, (iii) illustrating a probit regression implementation of BKMR for binary outcomes, and (iv) describing a fast version of BKMR that utilizes a Gaussian predictive process approach. All of the methods are illustrated using fully reproducible examples with the provided R code. Applying the methods to a continuous outcome example illustrated the ability of the BKMR implementation to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures in the context of a highly nonlinear, biologically-based dose-response function, and to estimate overall, single-exposure, and interactive health effects. The Gaussian predictive process method led to a substantial reduction in the runtime, without a major decrease in accuracy. In the setting of a larger number of exposures and a dichotomous outcome, the probit BKMR implementation was able to correctly identify the variables included in the exposure-response function and yielded interpretable quantities on the scale of a latent continuous outcome or on the scale of the outcome probability. This newly developed software, integrated suite of tools, and extended methodology makes BKMR accessible for use across a broad range of epidemiological applications in which multiple risk factors have complex effects on health.},
